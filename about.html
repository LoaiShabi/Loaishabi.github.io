<h1> My Journey </h1>
<p>My name is Loai Shabi, and I am currently a T-Level student at UTC OLP, specialising in Business with a strong interest in Finance. I am passionate about understanding how financial systems operate and how smart financial decisions can drive success in both business and personal contexts. My studies have provided me with a solid foundation in business principles, and I am eager to build on this by pursuing opportunities that allow me to apply my knowledge in real-world financial environments.

Outside the classroom, I am a highly motivated and dedicated individual. I thrive both as a leader and a team player, consistently demonstrating reliability, independence, and strong communication skills. Whether working on group projects or tackling individual assignments, I approach every task with focus and determination.

In addition to my academic work, I enjoy playing football and going to the gymâ€”activities me develop discipline, teamwork, and resilience. These qualities translate well into my professional life, where I aim to bring the same level of commitment and energy to everything I do.

I am now seeking an opportunity where I can apply my skills, gain practical experience, and continue developing within the financial sector. I am confident that my combination of academic knowledge, personal drive, and team-oriented mindset makes me a valuable asset in any finance-related role. </p>

        <h1>Work experience</h1>
        <p>Over the holidays, I gained valuable experience at Zoo Digital, where I worked on their official website to make sure everything was running smoothly and user-friendly. I was involved in checking functionality, spotting potential issues, and supporting improvements to the site. This experience not only gave me a real insight into how digital projects are managed but also helped me develop important soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, which I can carry forward into future roles.S</p>
